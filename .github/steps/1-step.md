## Step 1: Open a pull request

_Welcome to "Review pull requests"! :wave:_

Let's get started by opening a **pull request** on some changes that were recently added to the `update-game` branch.

### What is a pull request?

A **pull request** is a collaboration area where work in one branch is reviewed before merging it into another branch. It has different tabs to manage the conversation and easily review changes.

- **Conversation** - A general log of the pull request activity. It also provides an open space for fellow collaborators and the community to provide ideas, suggestions, and general feedback.
- **Commits** - A list of only the commits unique to the proposed branch.
- **Checks** - The results of any automations applied to the pull request using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). That's for another exercise, though. ðŸ˜Ž
- **Files Changed** - A [Diff](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary#diff) view that easily shows the proposed changes in a before/after view. It also has options to add comments and reviews in context.

> [!TIP]
> You can [create a draft pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request#:~:text=To%20create%20a%20draft%20pull%20request%2C%20use%20the%20drop%2Ddown%20and%20select%20Create%20Draft%20Pull%20Request%2C%20then%20click%20Draft%20Pull%20Request.%20If%20you%20are%20the%20member%20of%20an%20organization%2C%20you%20may%20need%20to%20request%20access%20to%20draft%20pull%20requests%20from%20an%20organization%20owner.%20See%20About%20pull%20requests.) for unfinished work. This can help avoid accidental merges or premature reviews.
