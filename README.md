# Review pull requests

_Collaborate and work together on GitHub._

## Welcome

All great projects start with collaboration. Pull requests are the foundation of teamwork on GitHub ‚Äî and pull request reviews give you the ability to work together and discuss changes specific to a pull request by commenting, requesting changes, or approving.

- **Who is this for**: Developers, new GitHub users, users new to Git, students, managers, teams.
- **What you'll learn**: When and how to request a review; how to provide a review of someone else's pull request.
- **What you'll build**: We'll be reviewing a pull request for a simple game.
- **Prerequisites**: We assume you are familiar with creating branches, commits, and pull requests‚Äîyou can learn this in our [Introduction to GitHub](https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-github) course.
- **How long**: This course takes less than 30 minutes to complete.

In this course, you will:

1. Open a pull request
2. Assign yourself
3. Leave a review
4. Suggest changes
5. Apply changes

When copying the exercise, we recommend the following settings:

- For owner, choose your personal account or an organization to host the repository.
- We recommend creating a public repository, as private repositories will [use Actions minutes](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions).

If the exercise isn't ready in 20 seconds:

1. After your new repository is created, wait about 20 seconds, then refresh the page.
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the issue created in your repository.
3. If the page doesn't refresh automatically, please check the [Actions](../../actions) tab.
   - Check to see if a job is running. Sometimes it simply takes a bit longer.
   - If the page shows a failed job, please submit an issue. Nice, you found a bug! üêõ
